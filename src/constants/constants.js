      "Using Vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript. I decided to create a Martial-arts Check-in App. The concept is similar to a commercial gym check-in app but the main difference is in martial arts we have belts that represents your rank. I've decided it would be a great idea if i can create an app where you can just easily check-in and it also keeps track of your hours so you and your instructors will get notified if when you're due for a promotion",
